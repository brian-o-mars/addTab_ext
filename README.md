# addTab_ext

This chrome extension adds a new tab to the tab group you are currently working from.

If you have a bunch of tabs open and you use tab groups to organise them, you'd find that if you want to use a new tab for the work you're doing, the + sign only creates a new tab at the end of the tab bar.
You now have to drag that new tab over to the group you were working from.
With this chrome extension, you can create a new tab and it automatically gets added to the group you are working from, moves the new tab to the left of your current tab and makes the new tab the new active tab.
